up vector can become tilted and annoy viewers\\n  - depends on application\\n- Interpolated path through SLERP rotates\\n  - around a fixed axis\\n  - at a constant speed\\n  - so, no acceleration\\n\\nIf we want to interpolate through a series of orientations $\\\\mathbf{q_1}, \\\\mathbf{q_2}, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{q_n}$, is SLERP a good choice?\\n\\n### Chained Quaternion Interpolation\\n\\n>When more than two orientations, say $$ q_0, q_1, ..., q_{n-1}$$, are available, and we want to interpolate from $$ q_0 $$ to $$ q_1 $$ to $$ q_2 $$, and so on until $$ q_{n-1} $$, SLERP can be used in a straightforward fashion. However, using $$ q_{i-1} $$ and $$ q_i $$ as arguments to SLERP, and then $$ q_i $$ and $$ q_{i+1} $$ as subsequent arguments, can cause sudden jerks to appear in the orientation.\\n\\n- **Can smooth the path by using a spherical curve instead of a straight line**\\n\\n>A better way to interpolate is to use some sort of spline. We introduce quaternions $$ \\\\hat{a}_i $$ and $$ \\\\hat{a}_{i+1} $$ between $$ q_i $$ and $$ q_{i+1} $$. Spherical cubic interpolation can be defined within the set of quaternions $$ q_i, \\\\hat{a}_i, \\\\hat{a}_{i+1}, $$ and $$ q_{i+1} $$. Surprisingly, these extra quaternions are computed as shown below:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\hat{a}_i = q_i \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\log(q_{i-1}^{-1} q_i) + \\\\log(q_i^{-1} q_{i+1})}{4}\\\\right)\\n$$\\n\\nThe interpolation function, **SQUAD** (Spherical Quadrangle Interpolation), is defined as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{squad}(q_i, q_{i+1}, \\\\hat{a}_i, \\\\hat{a}_{i+1}, t) = \\\\text{slerp}(\\\\text{slerp}(q_i, q_{i+1}, t), \\\\text{slerp}(\\\\hat{a}_i, \\\\hat{a}_{i+1}, t), 2t(1 - t))\\n$$\\n\\nThis approach allows for a smooth transition between quaternions, minimizing abrupt changes in orientation.\\n\\n### Interpolating Quaternions: The Hack\\nInterpolating quaternions should be done on the surface of a 3D unit sphere embedded in 4D space.\\nHowever, much simpler interpolation along a 4D straight line (open circles) followed by reprojection of the results onto the sphere (black circles) is often sufficient.\\n![](./CS415/w10.9.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n### T/F\\n- (T) Any orientation expressed as a quaternion can be expressed using Euler angles.\\n- (T) An Euler angle representation of an orientation uses less data than a quaternion representation.\\n- (F) The three axes used for the Euler angle representation must be unique. For example, using the X axis, then the Y axis and then the X axis would not work.\\n- (T) Changing the order of rotation can affect the result. For example, switching from an XYZ order to a YXZ order may change the orientation even if the three angles remain the same.\\n\\n\\n\\n# Game Physics\\n\\n## Simple Physics Engine\\n\\n### The Timestep\\nHow does the timestep effect the accuracy of the engine?\\nHow would you see that error in a game?\\nTimestep in games uses wall-clock time (sometimes a scaled version)\\n- Also related to framerate\\n\\nIf the physics timestep is tied to the framerate, what can happen?\\n\\n### UE Substepping\\nIn UE look at Project Settings > Engine > Physics\\n- Substepping creates a degree of framerate independence for physics\\n- When framerate drops, Unreal will add extra physics iterations\\n- Physics timestep will not exceed the max delta time\\n\\n## Collision Detection\\n\\n### Bounding Volumes\\nAABB=Axis Aligned Bounding Box\\nOOBB = Object-Oriented Bounding Box\\nBVH = Bounding Volume Hierarchy\\n\\n### BVH Construction\\nCan be constructed top down:\\n1.

Such algorithms take into account not only the light that comes directly from a light source (direct illumination), but also subsequent cases in which light rays from the same source are reflected by other surfaces in the scene, whether reflective or not (indirect illumination).\\nTheoretically, reflections, refractions, and shadows are all examples of global illumination, because when simulating them, one object affects the rendering of another (as opposed to an object being affected only by a direct source of light). In practice, however, only the simulation of diffuse inter-reflection or caustics is called global illumination.*\u201d -- Wikipedia\\n\\n### Lumen\\nLumen is Unreal Engine 5\'s fully dynamic global illumination and reflections system\\n- Enabled out of the box.\\n- Designed for next-generation consoles\\n- Supports high-end visualizations like architectural visualization\\n>\u201cLumen uses multiple ray-tracing methods to solve Global Illumination and Reflections.\\nScreen Traces are done first, followed by a more reliable method.

[2] Grades, when accompanied by constructive feedback, offer valuable insights into a student\u2019s performance. [3] This feedback is crucial for learning and development, as it guides students in understanding their mistakes and learning from them. [4] It also provides a roadmap for both students and teachers to focus their efforts more effectively. By highlighting strengths and weaknesses, grades combined with feedback can significantly enhance a student\u2019s learning experience.\\n\\n[5] While it\'s true that grades can foster competition, this isn\'t inherently negative. [6] Competition, when framed positively, can motivate students to strive for excellence and can prepare them for real-world scenarios where performance is often measured against peers. The key is to balance this with collaborative learning opportunities that emphasize teamwork and collective achievement, showing that individual success does not have to come at the expense of others.\\n[7] In summary, assigning grades to students does more good than harm.\\n\\n[1] I strongly advocate for the imposition of taxes on unhealthy products. [2] I completely align with Sam\'s belief that such taxes could significantly reduce the prevalence of major health issues in society. [3] Additionally, I propose that a portion of the revenue generated from these taxes should be directed towards health and nutrition research and development. [4] This could include funding for studies that investigate the impact of unhealthy foods, the development of healthier food alternatives, and the discovery of new strategies to promote better dietary habits across different population segments. Investing in this research could yield long-term solutions and insights crucial for tackling dietary-related health problems.\\n[5] Tanya raised a concern about the possibility of individuals opting for lower-quality goods as a cost-saving measure, but she overlooked the potential for government interventions [6] such as subsidies, incentives, or support programs aimed at making healthier food options more accessible and affordable. By implementing these measures alongside the unhealthy food tax, it ensures that nutritious alternatives are available, preventing people from turning to inferior quality products.\\n[7] To sum up, I am a firm proponent of taxing unhealthy products.\\n\\n[1] I am deeply convinced of the vast benefits that social media brings to the table. [2] I fully agree with Mark\'s view that social media has the power to uplift voices that have traditionally been ignored, offering them a platform for expression. [3] Beyond this, social media serves as a cost-effective and efficient way for businesses to engage with their audience, showcase their products or services, and expand their market reach. [4] The influence of user-generated content, such as reviews and personal narratives, is pivotal in guiding consumer decisions, thereby building trust and loyalty towards a brand. This vibrant, interactive space allows businesses to flourish and adapt within the constantly evolving digital landscape.\\n[5] While Sarah highlighted the impact of social media on youth mental health, she overlooked the possibility of mitigating these issues. [6] Implementing more rigorous policies and reporting systems is crucial. Fostering digital literacy and empathy among users, raising awareness of the consequences of online behavior, and offering mental health support resources can help cultivate a more secure and supportive online community.\\n[7] In summary, my firm belief is that the advantages offered by social media are significant.\\n\\n[1] Personally, I don\'t see targeted advertising as a matter of ethical concern. Echoing Mike\'s sentiment, I believe individuals have the choice to opt-out if targeted advertising does not sit well with them. I\'d like to add that targeted advertising offers a strategic advantage to businesses through the personalization of advertising messages. This personalization significantly enhances the likelihood of a message striking a chord with consumers on an individual basis. In turn, this fosters stronger and more meaningful connections between brands and their customers, leading to improved engagement, fostering brand loyalty, and potentially boosting sales and customer retention.\\nJessica pointed out the necessity for companies to craft advertisements that appeal to a broad audience. However, she overlooked the fact that as more brands lean into targeted advertising, those sticking exclusively to general advertising strategies risk losing their competitive advantage. Such brands may become out of touch or irrelevant to modern consumers who prefer personalized content.\\nFrom my perspective, targeted advertising does not raise ethical issues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Independent Writing (Outdated)\\n### High level points (macro, expandable, compatible):\\nEffectiveness and efficiency\\nEconomy and finance\\nTechnology and internet\\nHealth and environment\\nCulture and globalization\\nSocial relationship\\nCareer development\\nSocial equality\\n### Opening (intriguing, coherent, clear):\\n#### Hook:\\nIt\u2019s hard to deny that (opposite point) and such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that (opposite response).\\n#### Transition:\\nHowever, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.\\n### Points:\\nAs far as (point1) (point2), and (point3) are concerned, I strongly hold the belief that\u2026\\ne.g. In modern days, it might appear to some that their privacy is compromised due to increasing monitoring on their activities through cellphone tracking, CCTV, and other security measures, especially when people are not aware of the monitoring; others maintain that the tax we pay is wasted on such expensive measures.

However, in the long term, I always believe that a high quality life requires lots courage to take risks and the curiosity to try new things. Life is limited but fun of the world is infinite. We may not necessarily have to attempt extreme sports like skydiving and rock climbing but there are something not to be missed(unmissable), such as an opportunity to express ourselves on the stage,or exploring an interesting field **from scratch**.We mortals only live once, so we need to ceaselessly try to break through ourselves, to experience things that we have never met before,good or bad, and finally make everything worth the ticket price of living.\\n\\n### 2. \u5982\u4f55\u82b1\u94b1\\n\\n![Untitled](./eg2.png)\\nTo my mind, using unexpected wealth for practical purposes would be a better choice. Although spending it for pleasure only would give us lots of instant gaiety, it wouldn\u2019t be a long-term policy/it\u2019s obviously not sustainable for long periods, as wealth will eventually be depleted\xa0one day. However, if I use it to enroll in tutoring class\xa0like dancing or programming, I will acquire some useful skills permanently. For example, learning programming makes me more competitive in the job market so I may be able to earn more money in the future. Or, I can simply use this money for financial investment, even if I didn\u2019t be lucky enough to make more money,I have practiced how to manage my finances.\\n\\n### 3. learn other culture\\n![Untitled](./eg3.png)\\nI really think learning about other cultures holds great significance for several reasons. First, comprehension of exotic culture expends our mental frontiers\xa0so it may equip us with a more open and inclusive attitude towards various things around the world, which benefits us a lot in the increasingly interconnected globalized world. Also, learning about foreign culture may provide us more opportunities to make acquaintance with people\xa0from all over the world, and we may find common topics with each other\xa0and finally becomes friends.It enlarges my social circle\xa0spontaneously.\\n\\n### 4. online/offline\\n![Untitled](./eg4.png)\\nFor me, I prefer shopping online for lots of reasons. First, online shopping is time-saving and flexible\xa0as I can buy what I want just by searching online and don\u2019t need to waste hours waiting for transportation driving me to the store. What\u2019s more, large shopping platform provides us with a wide range of selections so we are more likely to get what suits the most while it will take hours for us to find something ideal in traditional offline\xa0stores crowding with people. Also, because online retailers don\u2019t need to pay for rental costs, the products may be cheaper with the same quality. That\u2019s why I prefer online shopping.\\n\\n### 5. alone/group\\n![Untitled](./eg5.png)\\nFor me, spending free time in shared activities with other people seems to be a better option even if staying alone also offers something valuable. First, as a person with outgoing disposition, getting along with others makes me more energetic and refreshing after tiring daily routines. What\u2019s more, in the process of shared activities, I can expend my mental frontiers by chatting with people from various background, and this may equip me with a more open and inclusive attitude towards various thing around the world, which helps me to be better accustomed to the increasingly interconnected world. At the same time, I can enlarge my social circle.\\n\\n### 6. \u7701\u94b1/\u82b1\u94b1\\n![Untitled](./eg6.png)\\nIn my view, I consider shopping only when I have a specific purchase to make would be a better option for several reasons. First, it can reduce impulsive consumption and prevent me from buying something useless for instant gaiety, which will not only waste money for no reason but occupy more storage space.\xa0What\u2019s more, staying away from casual consumption does helps with money management and financial investment, enables me to have a big purchase whenever I want and have enough money for future study or emergency.\\n\\n### 7.\\n\\n![Untitled](./eg7.png)\\n\\nIn my view, it\u2019s much more easier for us to eating healthy food today than decades ago for several reasons. \\n\\nFirst, technology advances have helped to\xa0transform plants with larger seeds and fruits, faster germination and higher annual yield so crops with higher quality and healthy value are more accessible for us, which means people today have much more choices to maintain a healthy diet.\\n\\nWhat\u2019s more, the development of medicine has made us more aware of the dietary proportion and trace elements required by the human body, enabling us to better plan our diet.\\n\\n### 8.\\n\\n![Untitled](./eg8.png)\\n\\nIn my view, buying fresh food and prepare meals by my own would be a better choice for several reasons. For one thing, prepared food in restaurants is always much more expensive than raw food in grocery as the former\u2019s price also includes store\u2019\xa0rental and labor costs, so self-catering habits can help us save lots of money for other use.\xa0Moreover, cooking our own food gives us more choices.We can make whatever we want to eat and make meals that are more suitable for our flavour, also, select materials with higher quality. Finally, there are many uncertainties in the hygiene of restaurants, on the contrary, our own meals are often healthy and hygienic.\\n\\n### 9.\\n![Untitled](./eg9.png)\\n\\nPersonally, I prefer to live in a big city.
